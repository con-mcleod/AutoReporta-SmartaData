# AutoReporta and SmartaData

I am an engineering intern at an Australian energy retailer. 

I have identified that their data management procedures could be improved upon. This repository will be used for the software solution that I have devised to drive such an improvement. 

The project is broken down into two main areas:

1) AutoReporta - Automation of the data collection process and using this created database to automatically generate useful reporting metrics

2) SmartaData - Apply statistical modelling/machine learning tools to the database created by the "AutoReporta" project to create a notification and diagnostics system to aid the analyst in making an operations decision



Updates including further development, debugging and cleaning of this repository have been moved to a private repository. Visit www.solai.com.au to see how this project has progressed (which occasionally will have downtime).
