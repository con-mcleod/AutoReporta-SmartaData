# SmartaData

I am an engineering intern at a major Australian energy retailer. 

Through my work, and in conversations with peers, I have identified that our data management procedures could be improved upon. This repository will be used for the software solution that I have devised to drive such an improvement. 

The project is broken down into two main areas:

1) AutoReporta - Automation of the data collection process and using this created database to automatically generate useful reporting metrics

2) SmartaData - Apply statistical modelling/machine learning tools to the database created by the "AutoReporta" project to create a notification and diagnostics system to aid the analyst in making an operations decision

This completed solution would represent a significant benefit to the company.
